# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
  - The flexbox feature was used in order to position certain elements like the different cards within the menu.
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
  - This would be the booking section of the webpage. A custom form for the coffee shop was made for users to book a reservation.
- CSS animation and transform
  - An example of this is the pulsating circle creating in the about section of this project's webpage.
- Also utilizes anchor links and identifiers
- Utilizes newer concept and incorporates them within the project such as the 'span' element. This element was used for both style and span element stretching to create the menu section.
  - example: '''<span class=header__span-accent>'''
    This was done in order to add two different styling options to the website's title

## Plan on improving the project

- One improvement I would make is to make the "Triple Espresso" logo interactive. Similar to other webpages, clicking the logo would take users back to the homepage.
